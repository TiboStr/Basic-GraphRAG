He was Marley\u0027s sole executor, administrator, and residuary legatee, as well as his friend and mourner. Initially, he lived in gloomy chambers alone except for himself, but then became the protagonist of this heartwarming tale that revolves around his life-changing encounters with ghosts from his past, present, and future.\n\nScrooge was portrayed as a harsh and miserly individual who only cared about money and refused to believe in spirits or their existence. He had a small fire in his counting-house compared to his clerk\u0027s minuscule coal flame, indicating his cold nature even towards employees. He celebrated Christmas alone, seemingly feeling no joy in the festivities while others did.\n\nHowever, this narrative underwent dramatic transformation as he interacted with Marley\u0027s ghost and experienced supernatural occurrences that forced him to confront his past actions and their consequences on others. Despite initially doubting the reality of these events and feeling terror upon hearing the ghost\u0027s voice, Scrooge eventually realized the gravity of his selfish nature.\n\nScrooge\u0027s character represented a lack of compassion and remorsefulness before his transformation; he was described as experiencing spontaneous combustion at one point in some descriptions. After his spiritual visits on Christmas Eve, he underwent an emotional shift that led him to value human connection more than material possessions. \n\nThe story portrays Scrooge as both struggling with personal greed and selfishness and eventually transforming into a kinder person. He came to recognize the situation\u0027s severity and the bad reputation of the area they were visiting.
