He is seated beside his father during their festive meal and is carried by his father because of his health issues. His well-being is a matter of concern throughout the narrative, but he does not die due to Scrooge’s benevolence after the protagonist's transformation. Instead, Tiny Tim becomes a beneficiary of Scrooge's goodwill and continues as a vital member of Bob Cratchit's family, remembered fondly by them.</data>

  <data key="d0">PERSON</data>
  <data key="d1">Ebenezer Scrooge is a central character in Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol," known for his transformation from miserliness to redemption. He was Marley’s partner and executor of his estate, described as a tight-fisted, miserly businessman who owned a counting-house and ran the business Scrooge and Marley with an indifferent demeanor towards human sympathy and charitable causes. Scrooge is disliked for his coldness, dismissal of Christmas festivities, and avoidance of family gatherings.

During Christmas Eve, Scrooge undergoes a series of transformative visits from supernatural beings that reflect on his past actions and current life choices. He sees visions of the past, present, and future with guidance from spirits who aim to change his outlook on life through emotional turmoil and spiritual enlightenment. These experiences influence him deeply, causing him to reconsider his disdain for Christmas celebrations and his treatment of others.

After these encounters, Scrooge undergoes a significant change of heart, showing kindness and generosity towards his employees and participating more actively in family gatherings like Fred's dinner party. This transformation is marked by happiness and relief as he embraces charity and celebration, reflecting on his past actions with newfound understanding and compassion. Throughout the narrative, Scrooge becomes well-known among businessmen for his altered demeanor and behavior, marking a profound shift in his character from a disliked, wealthy individual to someone who values community and familial bonds.</data>
