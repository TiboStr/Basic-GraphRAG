  <data key="d0">PERSON</data>
  <data key="d1">Ebenezer Scrooge, a central character in Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol," is initially known for his miserly nature and cold-hearted business practices. He runs the firm Scrooge and Marley and is often depicted as wealthy but lacking empathy towards others during Christmas Eve. Scrooges' strong dislike of Christmas and belief that it is meaningless lead him to handle Jacob Marley's funeral and business affairs with indifference. His reluctance to embrace the festive season and resolute maintenance of his business practices are well-documented, along with his argumentative stance when discussing the holiday’s value with his nephew.

Prior to his transformation, Scrooge lives alone in his deceased partner's chambers, spending his evenings reading newspapers and working on his banker's book. He demonstrates a lack of concern for those less fortunate during the festive season and is known for his miserly nature and cold-hearted demeanor as he runs his business with an iron fist.

However, after ghostly visitations that reflect upon his past, present, and future, Scrooge undergoes a profound spiritual transformation. This change leads to an improved opinion of himself and marks the beginning of a new chapter in his life where redemption is possible despite his previous actions and attitudes.</data>
